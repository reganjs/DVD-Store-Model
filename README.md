# DVD-Store-Model
A C++ program that manages DVD rental in a video rental store. Created an abstract data type that represents a DVD in a store. Considers all the data and operations that may be necessary for the DVD type to work well within a rental management system. Includes a print() member function that displays all the information about the DVD. Tested my data type by creating an array of ten DVD instances and filled them using information read from a test input file that I created. Displays the DVD information.
